## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

> As we explore all the exciting possibilities, we should also recognize the limitations that come with the journey:

- ~~At first, the app uses a direct link to view the web-rendered HTML code. Refreshing the page will send you back to the homepage automatically.~~

- ~~Working with Browser Restrictions: The music player may face some limitations when trying to work with local files due to browser security rules.~~

- Because of limitations in Android browsers (since KitKat version), it's not possible to access the entire file directory using file apps. This is an issue for using web-kit-directory.

- Working within Browser Limits: There are challenges when trying to retrieve device information, but we're overcoming them to make the experience smoother.
