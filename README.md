## Limitations

Music-Player includes all the basic features,a normal musicplayer possess,Due to the browser security policies and restrictions,Music-Player may not work as expected directly from online through github.So,Run it locally to experience it.
    Besides Music-Player,There is also a conflict in the device-info retrieval code because of the Browser Limitations......
